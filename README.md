Here are the files and script used for the analyses included in the paper.

Contents:

- The cvs files ending in _Diversity contain the estimated species richnness, Shannon's diversity index and first compononent of NMDS community composition for each taxon, as well as for all vertebrates. These files include the estimates for all seasons combined as well as for each season, all analyses were performed using the diversity estimated for the entire study period.
- The cvs files starting with AI_5min contain the ecoacoustic indices estimated for every 5 minutes sample for each recorder.
- The cvs files starting with Spearman contain the estimated correlations among ground-truthed diversity and the ecoacoustic indices for each taxon.
- DeLuca_Biodiversity_AcousticInices.r contains the script used to perform the analyses.
